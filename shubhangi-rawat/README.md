NAME: Shubhangi Rawat

Roll No: 25B0698
<br><br>
WHAT I IMPLEMENTED:
<br>
For week 1, I implemented basic functions in python using libraries like Numpy, pandas and Matplotlib.
<br>
As of week 2, I implemented linear regression and logistic regression using scikit learn library
I trained three models, two based on linear regression and one based on logistic regression.
<br><br>
WHAT I LEARNED:
<br>
As of week 1, I learnt how to code in python and how things can be made simpler using different libraries. Like Numpy for array, Pandas for arranging csv files and matplotlib for sketching different plots.
<br>
In week 2, I learnt how to do supervised learning. Linear regression and logical regression were the main part of my assignment.
<br><br>
WHAT CHALLENGES I FACED:
<br>
Learning theory was easy, but to code without having a one to one interaction felt a little difficult. It was like I have tools(libraries and functions) in hands but to use them without having a template or blueprint(like which function is themost suitable for a specific use and etc).
