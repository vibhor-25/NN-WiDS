WHAT I IMPLEMENTED :

During this course I have learned to implement basics of python and machine learning in various ways. I have utilised some of the libraries such as numpy, matplotlib and pandas. Moreover, we have worked with concepts such as linear regression, classification and gradient descent. I worked on data cleaning and preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values and converting categorical data into numerical form. I have been able to implement the theoritical concepts to practical implementation.

LEARNNG : 

As a begginer and a newbe in the world of AI and machine learning, this course has given me a great insight in coding. Neural Networks has helped me learn the basics and core of python in 1st week itself. Whereas the 2nd week was  dedicated to machine learning. I also learned how to implement and evaluate a linear regression model, understood the importance of feature selection, and developed a clearer understanding of how machine learning models learn from data. I have also had a hands on experience in learning from real time data.

CHALLENGES FACED : 

Alongside learning there were a lot of challenges. It took me sometime to get a hang of python. To get rid of syntax errors and debugging logical errors. It took a bit of practice to get used to writing efficient loops and dataframe. cleaning the dataset and handling non-numerical and inconsistent values are some of the more such problems. Yet, these have helped me to  stregthen my problem solving skills.
