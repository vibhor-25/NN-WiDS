What I implemented:
- Neural network model for WIDS dataset
- I used different libraries to train my data from a data set and then did testing.
- I also implemeted the different methods for finding the predicted values for a data set  

What I learned:
- Neural network fundamentals
- Training and testing algorithms and how to use them to code via different libraries of Python
- Debugging ML models and even creating them 

Challenges faced:
- Syntax and the use of different libraries included in the Python file 
- Model training and retrieval of the data for the same
- Carefully noting and analyzing the predicted data
