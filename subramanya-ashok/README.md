# Name : Subramanya Ashok
# Roll Number : 25b2481

# What I implemented 
#Assignment 1 -- python,numpy,pandas and matplotlib libraries
#Assignment 2 -- Linear regression , logistic regression,one-hot encoding,binary classification

# What I learned
#Assignment 1 -- learnt python,basics of above mentioned libraries , creating matrix and algebra of matrix using numpy , reading data of given csv file using pandas and ploting graphs,scattering points,labeling info  using matplotlib
#Assignment 2 -- learnt linear regression with multifeature data
- how it works and how to implement it using sklearn as well as manually(implemented gradient descent , creating 2d arrays and operating them using numpy)
- How logistic regression works
- Train-test split and scaling
- extracting info from a given csv data file 
- use of one hot encoding to convert strings into numerical data

# Challenges faced
-extracting info from a given csv data file and then using one hot encoding on nominal data 
- Git setup and PATH issues on Windows
