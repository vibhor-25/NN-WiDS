I learnt a lot of maths and ways to implement linear and logistic regression.
Actually I didn't use any direct functions from any library but wrote all the implementation codes myself.
It helped me to develop a lot of intuition and  basics , so I am quite confident with it.


It took a lot of time to code everything from basics and often I had to take some suggestions from AI and take note of them.
Also in the 2nd problem of Assignment2 , there were a lot mistakes in my 1st attempt which took a lot of time to correct it.
