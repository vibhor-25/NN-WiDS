During this journey, I explored various Python libraries and learned how to use them to implement programs that would otherwise require long and repetitive code.

I wrote multiple programs using Python that were significantly more efficient and concise compared to the classic C++ implementations I worked with in the previous semester. This helped me better understand abstraction, library usage, and rapid prototyping.

One major challenge was handling CSV file uploads in Google Colab. Since Colab does not store uploaded files permanently, files often had to be re-uploaded in new sessions. This required careful handling of file paths and workflow planning.

This experience improved my understanding of Python’s ecosystem and showed how high-level libraries can simplify complex tasks while maintaining clarity and efficiency.
