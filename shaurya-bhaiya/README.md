What I learnt and implemented:

  Not only did i learn and implement python and its various libraries but also to find various workarounds for the same effective output without the use of any libraries - to use pure logic and math. At the same time, didn't forget that efficiency of the code matters too. Learnt what data and sources to trust online. Getting to know linear regression and various other concepts of ML along with git and github as well.

Challenges faced:

  i did make quite a lot of mistakes at the beginning. Things seemed very overwhelimg at first; they still do a little but gradually and slowly understanding the concepts helped a lot.
