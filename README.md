Assignment 1:
I learnt the basics of standard ML libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib. While i still rely on google for the syntaxes, I have an idea as to how numpy arrays are used along with pandas dataframes to manipulate data easily. Also matplotlib is useful for looking at how the data is spread out. I implemented basic data manipulation with csv files , created and played around with numpy arrays and generated graphs for some math functions using matplotlib.

Assignment 2:
In week 2 we went over the basics on ML, learnt some new concepts relating to learning models, cost functions, linear regressions etc. We learnt how to use simple scikit functions to build entire linear/logistic regression models as donw in the assignment. We also learnt the core logic behind regressions and how we can implement it on our own.
