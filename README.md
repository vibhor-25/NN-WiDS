Name: M Suresh
Roll No.: 25B0309
I implemented Basic python libraries such as numpy , pandas, matplot lib to create models on the theories of linear and logistic regressions
I learned about various libraries of python and how to use them to implement them in AI models and learnt about theories of linear regression in machine learning.
Various types of challenges came in way, like attending mood ing=digo and techfest whilst giving time to the project at home and understanding the coding part was also a tough one
